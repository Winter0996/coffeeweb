This is my first project published to Github and my first website project on my jounrey to become a full stack web developer.
This project uses HTML5/CSS3 and I was able to explore and learn different ways of applying tables,links to media,surveys and basic layouts 
Website contains 6 pages and a tab bar on the top and bottom of each page of the website
